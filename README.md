# Numerical Analysis Algorithms
Hello! This repo is an implementation of the algorithms from Cheney and Kincaid's *Numerical Mathematics and Computing* textbook (Sixth edition) in C++. I am a beginner in C++ and a beginner in numerical analysis, so hopefully this is a good learning experience for me.

I am also using the textbook *A Tour of C++* (Second Edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup, so you may see some exercises from there dotted in when I need more familiarity with the language.

This repo is written with C++ 17. If I need to use a different version, I will update this readme. It uses g++ 15.1.1 because it came pre-installed on my system. These are not meant to be *good* implementations, they are for learning. If I complete these books I will read on C++ programming best practices and hopefully this will aide me. But one thing at a time.

Exercises are written with return type void as they are meant to represent main functions, and I just didn't want to create a million different files for each exercise.
